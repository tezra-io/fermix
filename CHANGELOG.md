# Changelog

All notable changes to Fermix are recorded here. The format follows

uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added — M4.8 Stage 1 (Burrito single-binary)
- `fermix` CLI dispatcher (`Fermix.CLI`) routing argv to subcommand modules
  (`setup`, `run`, `version`, `help`). `start`/`stop` are registered but
  print a Stage 4 deferral message and exit `2` rather than silently
  delegating to `run`.
- Release-safe `FermixCore.Setup.Runtime` extracted from
  `Mix.Tasks.Fermix.Setup`; the Mix task is now a thin wrapper.
- `FermixCore.Application.start/2` decides at boot whether the binary was
  invoked through Burrito (`Burrito.Util.running_standalone?/0`) and
  routes accordingly:
  - `setup` — full supervision tree (needed for `Memory.Repo`), then
    `System.halt/1` before sibling apps boot. No port bind.
  - `run` — enable Phoenix endpoint server in env, start the supervision
    tree, and spawn the foreground daemon CLI. All sibling apps remain
    `:permanent` so OTP keeps the BEAM alive.
  - `version` / `help` / `start` / `stop` / unknown — read-only;
    `System.halt/1` runs before any sibling app starts. No file logger,
    no `Memory.Repo`, no `TokenManager`, no port bind.
- Burrito wrap step in `mix.exs`; `macos-aarch64` target shipped first.
- `FERMIX_HTTP_BIND` runtime env (default `127.0.0.1`) parsed via
  `:inet.parse_address/1`. Invalid values raise during `runtime.exs`
  evaluation so the daemon fails loud at boot rather than silently
  binding the wrong interface.
- Auto-generated `SECRET_KEY_BASE` if the env var is unset, so a freshly
  installed binary can boot before the user has configured anything.

### Distribution — Stage 1 acceptance gate
- **Compressed binary size:** `fermix_macos_aarch64` is **11 MB**
  (`11,455,336 bytes`). Hard ceiling for M4.8 is 100 MB; well within
  budget.
- Stage 1 verified end-to-end on `aarch64-apple-darwin`:
  `version` / `help` / unknown commands halt before any supervision tree
  starts; `setup --print-state` boots the full tree and halts; `run`
  binds `127.0.0.1` by default and `0.0.0.0` via `FERMIX_HTTP_BIND`.

### Known
- The packaged release logs a startup warning that
  `priv/static/cache_manifest.json` is missing. This is a pre-existing
  Phoenix digest-pipeline gap (the cache manifest is not produced by the
  current build) and does not block `fermix run`. Tracked separately.
